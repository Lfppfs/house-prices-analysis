Here I show some useful visualizations of the dataset of housing prices.


![How is the price of a house influenced by its number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of floors, zipcode, and years of building and renovation? (The arrow indicates that there is a house with 33 bedrooms, it is not shown in order to aid visualization)](/home/lfppfs/Desktop/DS Test/scatterplotstest.png){ width=1500px; height=1000px }

As we can see in figure 1, as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms of a house increases, its price tends to increase. Houses that were renovated more recently also tend to have higher prices. The other variables don't seem to clearly influence house prices.

![How is the price of a house influenced by a presence of waterfront, by its view type, condition rating and grade?](/home/lfppfs/Desktop/DS Test/barplots.png)

By looking at figure 2, we can see that the plot of house prices versus the presence of waterfront shows that houses with waterfront have clearly higher prices than houses without it. View type also influences the price of a house, with higher view types showing greater house prices. Regarding condition rating, houses with condition ratings of 1 and 2 have lower prices than houses with condition ratings of both 3 and 4, and houses with condition rating of 5 have the highest prices of all categories. Finally, there is a clear influence of grading on house prices, as houses with higher grades show higher prices.
